"""Light anchors -- Deli Counter's lighting contract (`<name>.lights.json`).

Companion to the slot/gameplay manifests: derive WHERE lights belong and WHAT
kind they are from the rooms and openings the build already computed, and hand
that to the renderer (Lux) which decides how they look. Same philosophy as the
rest of the kit: bake the static shell, emit the placement as typed anchors.

Pure -- operates on the gameplay dicts, so it runs and tests outside Blender.
See docs/LIGHT_MANIFEST.md for the schema.
