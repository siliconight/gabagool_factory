"""Which state an Empty's window is painted in (0.179.0).

The walker, 2026-10-04, with a Bloodlines street as the comp: lights on in
the windows at night to show life. Read off in the factory root's
`docs/reference/EMPTIES_COMPS.md`, "LIT WINDOWS AT NIGHT": mixed per
building, MOST DARK, some lit warm, many of the lit ones behind bars,
curtains and blinds; a vacant 1990s rowhouse boarded.

Zoo (>= 1.64.0) paints the states (`zoo_keeper.core.window_panes`) and maps
each window's pane to its cell; this decides which state a window is in,
because which windows glow is a fact about the building. Pure and seeded --
`zlib.crc32` of the building, its seed and the slot -- so a rebuild paints
the same street.

PER BUILDING, NOT PER PLACEMENT. The state rides on the slot and so on the
module, and every placement of one archetype shares its modules: seven
copies of one rowhome across a street show one pattern seven times. More
variety needs more archetypes or a per-instance pick, and is not here.
