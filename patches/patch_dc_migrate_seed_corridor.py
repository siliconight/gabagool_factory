===================================================================================
One-shot, idempotent migration over the library, specs/*.json, Level
Factory's lf_ specs excepted as `layout_lint --all` excepts them. The seeder's
rule now asks that a piece standing on the floor leave `min_corridor_width`
(1.1 m) to every wall, stair reserve and standing volume
(`level_design._seed_clear`, `corridor`). Measured before this shipped: 40 of
the library's 69 seeded pieces did not, among them the two crate stacks that
cut deli_a01's up-stair off from its stairwell's door.

ASKED AS THE SEEDER ASKS IT, BEFORE FURNISH. Cover is placed first and
furniture after (`level_design.enrich`, "the order is load-bearing"), so each
spec is read without the volumes furnish wrote. A failing piece goes to the
nearest place the rule allows (`level_design.reseat_piece(..., corridor=True)`)
or, when nothing within reach answers, is DROPPED and named: a room where
nothing fits keeps its finding rather than a crate jammed into a passage,
which is `seed_cover`'s own rule. Then furnish runs again
(`migrate_furnish_recipes.migrate`), so every spec stays a fixed point of it.
A pass repeats until nothing fails, because one piece's move can free or
crowd another's place (seeded pieces stand 2.2 m apart).
