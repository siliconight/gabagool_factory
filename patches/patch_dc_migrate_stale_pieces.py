migrate_stale_pieces.py  --  move every piece that stands where a stair is
==========================================================================
One-shot, idempotent migration over specs/*.json for `layout_lint` L23 (a
piece over a slab opening or in a stair's walk on its own storey). Every
placement pass clears a piece of the stairs when it places it and is
idempotent by name, so a piece placed before a stair lengthened or widened is
never asked again; this asks once, now.

Each piece is moved by `level_design.reseat_piece`: the nearest place in its
room, clear of the stairs and the other pieces, out of any door's approach
it was not already in, and -- for a piece `seed_cover` placed -- only where
the seeder would put one. Pieces frozen in `stale_pieces_baseline.json` are
left alone: each needs a look before it moves. `lf_*` specs are Level
Factory's per-run transients and are skipped.

THEN THE SPEC IS REFURNISHED, so it stays a fixed point of furnish
(`test_club_fixtures`). `furnish` lays a room's furniture around what already
stands in it, so moving deli_a01's counter islands changes where its upper
hall's counter, vending machine and chairs go: the first run of this, which
did not refurnish, failed that test on deli_a01. A piece the refurnish
itself leaves over an opening is reported.

    python migrate_stale_pieces.py                # write specs/
    python migrate_stale_pieces.py --check        # report only; exit 1 on any to move
