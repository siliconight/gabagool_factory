Writes `deli_counter/test_navgate_entries.py`; refuses if it exists. The gate
patch (`patch_dc_navgate_entries.py`) went in first, so these are proven by
stashing it: every test here must fail on the pre-patch nav_gate.gd and

A stair whose two ends join is a stair, not a route. deli_a01's up-stair
passed the gate in every build -- both ends on one island, navigable "yes" --
while two crate stacks cut its foot off from the stairwell's door and its
whole upper storey with it (cold runs 9187 and 9188; Deli Counter 0.195.0;
`docs/findings/deli_a01_upper_storey_9188/` at the factory root).

The gate now snaps each storey-0 exterior door and garage ENTRY_IN m inside
its wall and reports, per stair, whether either end is on an island an
entrance is on. Run on the shipped deli_a01 it reads "stairs an entrance
reaches: 1/2 -- no entrance reaches stair deli_stair_up"; on 0.195.0's, 2/2.
Reported, not gated: the stair verdict and the exit code are unchanged, and
test_navgate_population freezes the library's set.
