"""Deli Counter 0.197.0: the walk-reach baseline is four rooms, not six.

    python patch_dc_open_plan_baseline.py

Anchored on walk_reach_baseline.json as `patch_dc_open_plan.py` wrote it.

`patch_dc_open_plan.py` froze six rooms, from a scratch census whose search
added open-floor links on top of the old walkable set WITHOUT re-following
stairs and doors from the rooms open floor reached. The shipped rule searches
one graph, and finds apartment_walkup_a01's bedroom and office walkable: its
front hall opens straight into the kitchen (no partition on that edge), the
up-stair climbs from the kitchen to the bedroom, and a 1.25 m door joins the
bedroom to the office. test_walk_baseline_has_not_gone_stale said so first.
