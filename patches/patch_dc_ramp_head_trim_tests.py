half of what `test_stair_ramp_foot.py` proves for the foot (0.190.0).

Measured 2026-10-06 (roadmap 189 at the factory root): every one of the
library's 174 ramps topped out 0.19 to 0.21 m over the floor it delivers to,
and a capsule of Laser Tag's size never started down deli_a03's stair. Going
UP the ledge is a drop; coming DOWN it is a riser.

THE HEAD IS TRIMMED, NOT SUNK. Sinking the ramp by the overshoot landed the
head and was built and reverted: the ramp ran a riser under the nosings, every
visual tread stood above it, and the nav bake -- which reads visual meshes --
failed stair traversal on 94 of 144 shells. So the property that matters as
much as the flush head is the one tested here as
`test_no_tread_stands_above_the_ramp`.
