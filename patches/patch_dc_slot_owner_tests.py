SRC = '''"""A slot owns its own greybox nodes, never a sibling slot's (0.203.0,
roadmap 205).

THE DEFECT. The placement gate (`portable_building._slot_greybox_extent`) and
the composer's fit (`themed_tscn._slot_extent`) counted a greybox node as part
of a slot when its name was the slot id or began `<slot_id>_` -- the rule for
an opening's own parts (`_lintel`, `_sill`, `_pane`). A SIBLING slot whose id
begins the same way was swallowed with them. gas_station_a02's `cooler_run`
(3.28 m, x 12.62..15.90) took in `cooler_run_sales` (8.0 m, x -9.54..-1.54)
and measured 25.442 m, so the gate refused the module built exactly to its
slot: `PRESENTATION_PLACEMENT_MISMATCH`, cold run 9195's art leg stopped. The
composer orients every module by the same extent.

Measured over the library on 2026-10-07: 9 of 145 buildings carry a slot id
that begins another's (19 pairs), and in 5 the sibling has greybox nodes --
the three pawn shops' `counter` (9.86 x 6.36 m read, 4.0 x 0.7 its own) and
the two gas stations' `cooler_run`.

THE RULE. A node belongs to the LONGEST slot id that names it.
