"""Deli Counter 0.202.0 tests: a wall piece needs a wall behind it.

    python patch_dc_wall_backing_tests.py

Writes `deli_counter/test_wall_backing.py`, NEW (refuses if it exists). Run
BEFORE `patch_dc_wall_backing.py`: the open-edge, part-wall, library and
generated-deli tests fail on 0.201.0; the walled-edge and exterior guards
pass either side, so the rule cannot hide slots a wall does hold.

MEASURED FIRST (the factory's docs/findings/wall_pieces_without_walls/): 155 of
the library's 4,086 furnished wall pieces, in 18 shells, stand 0.18-0.19 m off
a room edge with no built wall behind them -- deli_a01's ATM and two paper
lottery boards in front of its deli case among them.
