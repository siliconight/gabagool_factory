"""The backdrop tree with a silhouette (Zoo 1.97.0, roadmap 228 step F) -- pure, no bpy.

The walker, on cold run 9227's parkland: "those trees in the distance are a little lazy imo
(giant lolipops vs. trees)". `backdrop_forms.tree_plan` is the trunk, the limbs and the lobes
the recipe builds; these hold its proportions, its forms and its budget.
